</html><h1>Night-Before Prep-Cooking Checklist for Blackened Salmon with Creamy Mango Salsa and Garlic Parmesan Roasted Asparagus</h1>

<ul style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold;">
<li><strong>Salmon:</strong></br>
Prepare marinade by mixing together olive oil, lemon juice, garlic, and blackening seasoning. Refrigerate overnight to allow the flavors to meld.</li>
<li><strong>Mango Salsa:</strong></br>
Peel and dice mango, then combine with red onion, jalapeño, cilantro, lime juice, and salt in a bowl. Cover and refrigerate overnight to allow the flavors to meld.</li>
<li><strong>Garlic Parmesan Roasted Asparagus:</strong></br>
Trim asparagus spears and place on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Drizzle with olive oil, sprinkle with minced garlic, grated parmesan cheese, salt, and pepper. Toss to coat evenly. Refrigerate overnight to allow the flavors to meld.</li>
<li><strong>Creamy Mango Sauce:</strong></br>
Combine heavy cream, diced mango, lime juice, honey, and a pinch of salt in a blender or food processor. Blend until smooth, then refrigerate overnight to allow the flavors to meld.</li>
</ul>

Note: This list assumes that you will be cooking the salmon, roasting the asparagus, and making the creamy mango sauce on the evening of service. The night before, focus on preparing the marinade, mango salsa, garlic parmesan roasted asparagus, and creamy mango sauce to ensure a smooth and efficient service.<h1>Suggested Wine Pairing</h1><ul><li>Selected Wine: To Kalon Vineyard Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (2020)</li><li>The selection was made due to the bold and full-bodied nature of this wine, which complements the rich flavors of the blackened salmon. The tannins in the wine will also help cut through the creaminess of the mango salsa.</li></ul>

The flavors present in this recipe are:

- Blackening seasoning
- Mango
- Garlic
- Asparagus

These flavors can be paired with a bold and full-bodied red wine, such as the To Kalon Vineyard Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (2020). The wine's tannins will help cut through the richness of the dish, while its fruit-forward flavors will complement the sweetness of the mango.<!DOCTYPE html>

<ul style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold;">
<li>Prepare the Saffron Rice Pilaf:</li>
  <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Measure and rinse 1 cup of uncooked white rice.</li>
    <li>Mix 2 cups of water with 1/4 teaspoon of saffron threads in a saucepan, heating it over medium heat until the liquid is absorbed.</li>
    <li>Combine cooked rice with 1 tablespoon of olive oil, salt, and pepper in a large bowl.</li>

  <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Mix 1/2 cup of mayonnaise with 1 tablespoon of harissa paste in a bowl.</li>

    <li>Mix 1 cup of fresh or frozen cranberries with 1/4 cup of chopped fresh ginger in a bowl.</li>
    <li>Add 2 tablespoons of honey and 1 tablespoon of apple cider vinegar to the mixture, stirring well.</li>
  </ul>

<li>Prepare the Baked Salmon:</li>
  <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Rinse and pat dry 4 salmon fillets (6 ounces each).</li>
    <li>Season with salt, pepper, and your choice of herbs (e.g., thyme, rosemary).</li>

  </ul>

</ul><h1>Suggested Wine Pairing</h1><ul><li>Baked Salmon with Saffron Rice Pilaf, Roasted Sweet Potatoes with Harissa Aioli, and Cranberry-Ginger Chutney...</li></ul>

The flavors in this recipe include:

* Smoky and spicy from the harissa aioli
* Tangy and sweet from the cranberry-ginger chutney
* Rich and creamy from the saffron rice pilaf
* Delicate and flaky from the baked salmon

Considering these flavors, I would recommend pairing it with the <h1>Selected Wine: </h1><i>Napa Valley Sauvignon Blanc (2022)</i>

The selection was made because this wine's crisp acidity and bright citrus notes will cut through the richness of the saffron rice pilaf and the creaminess of the harissa aioli. The wine's fresh and herbaceous flavors will also complement the herbal notes in the cranberry-ginger chutney, while its minerality will enhance the smokiness from the harissa. The delicate flavor profile of the baked salmon won't overpower the wine, allowing it to showcase its bright acidity and citrus notes.<!DOCTYPE html>
