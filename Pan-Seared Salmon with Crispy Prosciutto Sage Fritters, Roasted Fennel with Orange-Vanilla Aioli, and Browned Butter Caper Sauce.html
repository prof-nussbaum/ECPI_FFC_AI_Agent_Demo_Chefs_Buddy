<h2>Pan-Seared Salmon with Crispy Prosciutto Sage Fritters, Roasted Fennel with Orange-Vanilla Aioli, and Browned Butter Caper Sauce.</h2> 
<p>The dish is presented on a elegant white plate, garnished with fresh sage leaves. The pan-seared salmon fillet is placed in the center of the plate, topped with crispy prosciutto sage fritters that add a satisfying crunch to each bite. To the side, roasted fennel is arranged artfully, its anise-flavored sweetness complemented by the creamy orange-vanilla aioli. A drizzle of browned butter caper sauce adds a rich and savory element to the dish, tying all the flavors together.</p>
