<h2>Poached Salmon with Saffron Risotto, Roasted Fennel, and Truffle Butter Sauce.</h2> 
<p>Indulge in the rich flavors of this exquisite dish, where tender poached salmon is paired with a creamy saffron risotto, roasted fennel adds a pop of color and crunch, and truffle butter sauce brings it all together. The delicate fish is perfectly cooked to retain its moisture, while the risotto provides a comforting base for the dish. The roasted fennel adds a sweet and anise-flavored contrast, balanced by the earthy richness of the truffle butter sauce.</p>
